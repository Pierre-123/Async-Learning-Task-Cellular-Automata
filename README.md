A Modified Model of Follower in NetLogo that gives them lanes alike traffic

Essentially the above tldr. I saw in the Art folder of the existing models on NetLogo that one of them was the Follower and it looked a nice, chaotic turtle-mess- so I decided to make them orderly in lanes. It looks nicer now, akin to trains or trucks in lanes (don't mind them colliding with each other). 

You'll see something like below:

It looks better moving I swear I just dont know how to make gifs of this. Anyways, run it and it looks nice, traffic, trains, lanes, rain, wind- it feels like a lot of things horizontal and vertical.
